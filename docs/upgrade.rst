Upgrade guide
=============

The |version| release of |project| is not compatible with the legacy
django-registration (previously maintained by James Bennett). Major backwards
incompatible changes will be recorded here, but for a full list of changes
between versions you should refer to the `CHANGELOG
<https://github.com/macropin/django-registration/blob/master/CHANGELOG>`_.

Django version requirement
--------------------------

As of |version|, |project| requires Django 1.8 or newer;
older Django releases may work, but are officially unsupported. Additionally,
|project| officially supports Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.

- **Native migration support breaks South compatibility**: An initial native
  migration for Django > 1.7 has been provided. South users will need to
  configure a null migration with (`SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES`) in
  `settings.py` as shown below:

  ::

      SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES = {
          'registration': 'registration.south_migrations',

  parameters of the`register` method in RegistrationView have changed.

- **base.html template required**: A `base.html` template is now assumed to
  exist. Please ensure that your project provides one for |project| to inherit
  from.
- **HTML email templates**: |project| now uses HTML email templates. If you
  previously customized text email templates, you need to do the same with
  the new HTML templates.

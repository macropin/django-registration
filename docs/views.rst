Registration views
==================

In order to allow the utmost flexibility in customizing and supporting
different workflows, |project| makes use of Django's support
for `class-based views
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/>`_. Included
in |project| are two base classes which can be subclassed to
implement whatever workflow is required.

.. class:: RegistrationView

   A subclass of Django's `FormView
   <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/generic-editing/#formview>`_,
   which provides the infrastructure for supporting user registration.

   Useful places to override or customize on a ``RegistrationView``
   subclass are:

   .. attribute:: disallowed_url

      The URL to redirect to when registration is disallowed. Should
      be a string, `the name of a URL pattern
      <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/#naming-url-patterns>`_. Default
      value is ``registration_disallowed``.

   .. attribute:: form_class

      The form class to use for user registration. Can be overridden
      on a per-request basis (see below). Should be the actual class
      object; by default, this class is
      :class:`registration.forms.RegistrationForm`.

   .. attribute:: success_url

      The URL to redirect to after successful registration. Should be
      a string, the name of a URL pattern, or a 3-tuple of arguments
      suitable for passing to Django's `redirect shortcut
      <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/shortcuts/#redirect>`_. Can
      be overridden on a per-request basis (see below). Default value
      is ``None``, so that per-request customization is used instead.

   .. attribute:: template_name

      The template to use for user registration. Should be a
      string. Default value is
      ``registration/registration_form.html``.

   .. method:: get_form_class()

      Select a form class to use on a per-request basis. If not
      overridden, will use :attr:`~form_class`. Should be the actual
      class object.

   .. method:: get_success_url(user)

      Return a URL to redirect to after successful registration, on a
      per-request or per-user basis. If not overridden, will use
      :attr:`~success_url`. Should be a string, the name of a URL
      pattern, or a 3-tuple of arguments suitable for passing to
      Django's ``redirect`` shortcut.

   .. method:: registration_allowed()

      Should return a boolean indicating whether user registration is
      allowed, either in general or for this specific request.

   .. method:: register(form)

      Actually perform the business of registering a new user. Receives the
      registration ``form``. Should return the new user who was just
      registered.


.. class:: ActivationView

   A subclass of Django's `TemplateView
   <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/base/#templateview>`_
   which provides support for a separate account-activation step, in
   workflows which require that.

   Useful places to override or customize on an ``ActivationView``
   subclass are:

   .. attribute:: template_name

      The template to use for user activation. Should be a
      string. Default value is ``registration/activate.html``.

   .. method:: activate(*args, **kwargs)

      Actually perform the business of activating a user account. Receives any
      positional or keyword arguments passed to the view. Should return the
      activated user account if activation is successful, or any value
      which evaluates ``False`` in boolean context if activation is
      unsuccessful.

   .. method:: get_success_url(user)

      Return a URL to redirect to after successful registration, on a
      per-request or per-user basis. If not overridden, will use
      :attr:`~success_url`. Should be a string, the name of a URL
      pattern, or a 3-tuple of arguments suitable for passing to
      Django's ``redirect`` shortcut.

.. class:: ResendActivationView

   A subclass of Django's FormView`
   <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/class-based-views/generic-editing/#formview>`_
   which provides support for resending an activation email to a user.

   Useful places to override or customize on an ``ResendActivationView``
   subclass are:

   .. attribute:: template_name

      The template to use for user activation. Should be a
      string. Default value is ``registration/resend_activation_form.html``.

   .. method:: resend_activation(self, form)
        Given an email, look up user by email and resend activation key
        if user is not already activated or previous activation key has
        not expired. Note that if multiple users exist with the given
        email, no emails will be sent.  Returns True if activation key
        was successfully sent, False otherwise.


   .. method:: render_form_submitted_template(self, form)
        Renders resend activation complete template with the submitted
        email.

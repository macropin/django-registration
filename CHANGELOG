Version 1.0, 17 June 2013
-------------------------

(Taken from release-notes.rst in this release)

* The 1.0 release of django-registration represents a complete
  rewrite of the previous codebase. For information on upgrading,
  consult :ref:`the upgrade guide <upgrade>`.

* The largest overall change is that in place of the monolithic backend
  classes and function-based views found in django-registration 0.8, in
  1.0 all views are class-based. A "backend" now consists of,
  typically, one or two subclasses of :ref:`the built-in base views
  <views>`.

* Implementing these as class-based views allows for far simpler
  configuration and customization, without the overhead involved in
  supporting large numbers of optional keyword arguments to
  function-based views, or the need to provide a separate class-based
  infrastructure for implementing the logic of registration.

* Notably, this implementation is also completely backwards-compatible
  for users of django-registration 0.8 who simply used the recommended
  default URLConf for one of the supplied backends; those URLConfs exist
  in the same locations, and have been rewritten to point to the
  appropriate class-based views with the appropriate options.


Version 0.8, 24 March 2012:
---------------------------

* Backend-based rewrite. See docs/upgrade.rst for details.

* Compatibility through Django 1.4.


Version 0.7, 6 November 2008:
-----------------------------

* Project hosting moved from Google Code to Bitbucket, and from a
  Subversion repository to Mercurial.

* Added test suite.

* Full Django 1.0 compatibility.

* Registration and activation views now accept an ``extra_context``
  argument, identical to the way that argument works in Django's
  generic views.

* Added a custom management command for cleaning up expired
  registrations; you can now run ``manage.py cleanupregistration`` to
  handle this.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The "username" field in
  ``RegistrationForm`` is now a ``RegexField``.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Removed the standalone script for
  deleting expired user registrations; use the new management command
  instead.


Version 0.6, 29 July 2008:
--------------------------

* Packaged from revision 166 in Subversion.

* Fixed a multiple-objects exception in
  ``RegistrationFormUniqueEmail`` when multiple users already have the
  same email address.

* Changed the ``success_url`` of the ``register()`` view to use
  reverse URL resolution.

* Added an ``extra_context`` argument to the ``register`` and
  ``activate`` views, mimicking its functionality in Django's generic
  views.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Switched the admin declaration to be
  compliant with the newforms-admin refactor; the admin declaration
  now lives in ``registration/admin.py``.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Switched form imports from using
  ``django.newforms`` to using ``django.forms``; the old style now
  raises a deprecation warning on Django trunk and on Django 1.0
  alpha.


Version 0.5, 4 June 2008:
-------------------------

* Packaged from revision 155 in Subversion.

* Added Serbian translation.

* Added Italian translation.

* Username/email uniqueness checks are now case-insensitive. This is
  potentially backwards-incompatible if you relied on them being
  case-sensitive, but I don't know of any reason why you'd be doing
  that.

* Included forms now use lazy translations.

* The ``register`` view can now handle files submitted for use in form
  processing.

* Reactivation of a manually-deactivated account is now prevented by
  changing the activation key, on successful activation, to a dummy
  string which will fail on subsequent activation attempts.


Version 0.4p2, 10 Feburary 2008:
--------------------------------

* Added Brazilian Portuguese translation.

* Added Japanese translation.

* Added Hebrew translation.

* Minor documentation fixes.


Version 0.4p1, 16 December 2007:
--------------------------------

* Packaged from revision 129 in Subversion.

* Added Polish translation.


Version 0.4, 8 December 2007:
-----------------------------

* Packaged from revision 122 in Subversion.

* Added Greek translation.

* Added Russian translation.

* Changed ``maxlength`` to ``max_length`` now that Django issues a
  deprecation warning for it.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Changed the password validation to be
  on ``clean()`` instead of ``clean_password2()``. This means that
  errors from this must be accessed via ``non_field_errors()``.


Version 0.3p5, 6 October 2007:
------------------------------

* Packaged from revision 112 in Subversion.

* Added German translation.

* Fixed a mismatch between the default ``RegistrationForm``'s maximum
  length on email addresses and the actual maximum length on Django's
  ``User`` model.

* Fixed a situation where bad input for the ``password1`` field on
  ``RegistrationForm`` could cause validation of ``password2`` to fail
  with an exception.


Version 0.3p4, 4 October 2007:
------------------------------

* Packaged from revision 101 in Subversion.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: In response to larger numbers of
  complaints from people trying to use the example templates as-is,
  the example templates have been removed.


Version 0.3p2, 23 September 2007:
---------------------------------

* Packaged from revision 100 in Subversion.

* Fixed ``activate`` view to actually take the ``template_name``
  argument.


Version 0.3p1, 22 September 2007:
---------------------------------

* Packaged from revision 99 in Subversion.

* Fixed a typo in docs/overview.txt.

* Fixed a typo in bin/delete_expired_users.py.

* Added French translation.


Version 0.3, 19 September 2007:
-------------------------------

Packaged from revision 89 in Subversion; download at
http://django-registration.googlecode.com/files/registration-0.3.tar.gz

* Changed ``register`` and ``activate`` views to accept
  ``template_name`` keyword argument for selecting a custom template.

* Changed ``register`` view to accept ``form_class`` keyword
  argument specifying the form to use.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Changed
  ``RegistrationManager.create_inactive_user`` to use a template for
  the subject of the activation email.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Removed the ``tos`` field from
  ``RegistrationForm``; if you were relying on it, switch to using
  ``RegistrationFormTermsOfService`` instead.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The activation email template now
  receives the current ``Site`` object as the context variable
  ``site``, and the ``current_site`` variable, which only held the
  domain, is no longer available.

* Added script ``bin/delete_expired_users.py`` with instructions on
  how to use it as a cron job to clean up expired/inactive accounts.

* Marked strings for translation and added ``locale`` directory so
  that translations can be added.

* Updated to deal with merge of Django's Unicode branch into trunk;
  now using Unicode-aware functions everywhere.


Version 0.2, 29 May 2007:
-------------------------

Packaged from revision 76 in Subversion; download at
http://django-registration.googlecode.com/files/registration-0.2.tar.gz

* Added ability to specify a callback in
  ``RegistrationManager.create_inactive_user`` or in the ``register``
  view to enable creation of site-specific user profile.

* Separated out the logic of creating the profile into a new method on
  ``RegistrationManager``: ``create_profile``.

* Added URLConf support for various useful views in
  ``django.contrib.auth``.

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed the ``key_generated`` field
  from ``RegistrationProfile``; activation key expiration is now
  calculated based on the ``date_joined`` field in the ``User`` model.
  Drop the ``key_generated`` column from your database when upgrading
  from 0.1.


Version 0.1, 23 May 2007:
-------------------------

Packaged from revision 56 in Subversion; download at
http://django-registration.googlecode.com/files/registration-0.1.tar.gz

* First packaged version using distutils.

* Added docs/ directory and overview.

        Regularly clearing out accounts which have never been
        activated serves two useful purposes:

        1. It alleviates the ocasional need to reset a
           ``RegistrationProfile`` and/or re-send an activation email
           when a user does not receive or does not act upon the
           initial activation email; since the account will be
           deleted, the user will be able to simply re-register and
           receive a new activation key.

        2. It prevents the possibility of a malicious user registering
           one or more accounts and never activating them (thus
           denying the use of those usernames to anyone else); since
           those accounts will be deleted, the usernames will become
           available for use again.

        If you have a troublesome ``User`` and wish to disable their
        account while keeping it in the database, simply delete the
        associated ``RegistrationProfile``; an inactive ``User`` which
        does not have an associated ``RegistrationProfile`` will not
        be deleted.

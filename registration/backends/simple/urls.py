"""
URLconf for registration and activation, using django-registration's
one-step backend.

If the default behavior of these views is acceptable to you, simply
use a line like this in your root URLconf to set up the default URLs
for registration::

    (r'^accounts/', include('registration.backends.simple.urls')),

This will also automatically set up the views in
``django.contrib.auth`` at sensible default locations.

If you'd like to customize registration behavior, feel free to set up
your own URL patterns for these views instead.

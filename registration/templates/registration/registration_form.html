Used to show the form users will fill out to register. By default, has
the following context:

``form``
    The registration form. This will be an instance of some subclass
    of ``django.forms.Form``; consult `Django's forms documentation
    <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/>`_ for
    information on how to display this in a template.
